# Adding a tabbed pagebuilder element to a Project Page.

Most of the 'Project' pages for Onehealth include an assets section at the bottom of the page.  This is a tabbed element containing various types of content such as "Deliverables".
If a project page doesn't have this tabbed area for content at the bottom of the page, the content was not available when it was created, so this tutorial will show you how to add the tabbed element and configure it to display the content you want.

Using the WPBakery pagebuild editor is quite straight forward.  The content is made up of 'elements' that provide different styles, functions etc.  like showing an image gallery or a text area.  These are all held together in by an element like a section, row or column to help organise the various elements on the page. Most of these elements are built in to the WPBakery tool but they can be extended by 3rd party extensions or bespoke elements created for OHEJP.

The tricky aspect of WPBakery is making sure you pleace the elements in the right place.  For this Tabbed area, it sits at the bottom of the page, so you can add it as the last elelement by clicking the the last "+" shown here:

> Notice the difference in the "Add elements" buttons, one is surrounded by a new inner section area, this is not what we want in this case:
{: .prompt-warning }
![Add element in new section button](/assets/img/2023-07-28 08_57_12 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE.jpg)

This opens up the Element selection dialogue.  The tab we need is the "My Elements" tab where you will find several OHEJP elements.  These have been pre-configured to allow specific styling to be added to the make the content look a certain way, without then need for user intervention.  The first element is the Tabbed content element:
![Tabbed content element select](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_12_40 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE.jpg)

This should appear at the bottom of your page like this:
![Newly added Tab element](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_17_13 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE - newly added tabbed area.jpg)

This will need to be adjusted to suite your requirements, firstly the number and the names of those Tabs"
![Change title for specific tab](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_22_07 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE - change tab title.jpg)

Too add another tab, simply click the "+" in the last tab to the right:
![Add an additional tab](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_29_52 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE - add tab.jpg)

Finally we need to add content into that tab.  To do this we add a bespoke Text Area element specifically for this use case, make sure to click the right "+":
![Adding content to the tab](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_35_17 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE - add element to tab.jpg)

Clicking the "+" 'add element' button once again opens the Element selector dialogue and in My Elements, select the text area element for this use case:
![Pre-configured Text Area](/assets/img/2023-07-28 09_12_40 - Edit Page BIOPIGEE-otherelement.jpg)

Here you can add the text you wish to add for the project.
