# Changing titles or slugs(permalinks) of posts or pages

Once a post or page has been created, following a slight delay, the content will get indexed by Search engines.  This content is indexed by the url of the content which is 'built-up' with the permalink and slug entry for the post/page.  The permalink is made up of the site domain and the category that the content is placed in.  the slug is made up from the title of post/page (lower-cased and special characters replaced by '-'):

e.g. A newsletter post, placed in the News/Newsletter category, will have a permalink of https://domainname.com/news/newsletter/
The slug is appended to this, like so: https://domainname.com/news/newsletter/the-name-of-the-post

To edit the post simply click the edit button and change the slug:

Once this indexing has taken place, it is not advised to change the slug UNLESS you also add a redirect to make sure any traffic going to the old url, is sent to the new url.  It is OK to change the post/page title without changing the slug BUT if the new title is more descriptive and contains more contextual clues for the type of content, then changing the slug is appropriate.

Once you change a slug and update the Post, the system will recognise this change and suggest the creation of a redirect for you, in the Notice section of the admin area:

By clicking on the "Create redirect" button, you will open this interface:

To create the redirect, the default settings should be OK but ensure the two highlighted options are enabled, before 
pressing Publish to confirm.
